To decrypt message 10, it takes time to display and write to file. So I comment the code for message 10.
The rest is fine.
I recommend to run other code before running the code for message 10.
I have test the message 10 and I store the message 10 results in Mess10.txt so that you can check the document to see the answer of message 10.
After decryption, all decrypted files are located in src\TextFile.
